<label id="label">How to protect your Computers and Laptops</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Make sure your security software is up-to-date. Devices’ operating systems and Internet-connected software (like email programs, web browsers, and music players) should be updated regularly. Your computer will typically notify you when a software update is available.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Install antivirus and antimalware software. If you do not have security software, install a firewall and antivirus software and keep them up-to-date. There are a variety of reputable products available for free or that have a free trial period. These programs help identify the latest threats and allow a user to remove malicious software from their device. Do your research before installing any program and beware of scams that attempt to lure you into disclosing your personal information or that direct you to download programs that may contain malware.
</label>
<br>
<br>
<label id="label">Disable connections when you aren’t using them. If your computer uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to connect to the Internet and other devices, you should turn these features off when you aren’t using them. This can prevent unknown persons from using your network or accessing your devices without your knowledge.</label>
<br>
<br>
<label id="label">How to Protect your smart phones</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Create a strong PIN or passcode. If your device is lost or stolen, a strong passcode may prevent a thief from accessing all the information stored on your phone. Many smartphones also allow you to remotely wipe the information from your computer in the event of loss or theft.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Only install trusted applications. Some criminals make available applications (or “apps”) that look and function like legitimate apps, but actually install malware to your smartphone. Be sure to download apps only from trusted sources, and check the number of downloads and read reviews to makes sure you aren’t downloading a “look-alike” app.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Keep your software up-to-date. Smartphone manufacturers and app developers regularly release software updates that often include security improvements. Check often to ensure that your smartphone has the most up-to-date software.</label>
<br>
<br>
<label id="label">How to protect Internet connected Devices</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Review your network and device names. Is your cell phone or home network named using your last name or other personally identifying information? This can make your device more vulnerable to attack, since it connects the device to you and makes it easier for hackers to guess your password. You should change the name of your devices and network so hackers cannot identify you so easily.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Create unique passwords for all devices. When you purchase a new device, it often comes with a simple, default password. Many people set up unique passwords for their computer or phone, but neglect to do so for their Internet router or other smart device. Unknown to the user, hackers can easily gain access to these devices, and use them to flood websites with so much traffic the site goes down or hack into your network. If, for example, your “smart” kitchen stove is connected to the Internet and has a simple password, a hacker could use the stove to access your wireless network and hack your computer or phone. When you get a new Internet-connected device, you should be sure to create a strong, unique password for it.</label>
<br>
<br>
<label id="label">How to protect your Online Account</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Delete suspicious emails. It is best to delete spam or dubious-looking emails without opening them. If you receive a questionable email from a friend or family member, it is best to contact that person and verify he or she sent it before opening the email or clicking on a link or attachment.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Use secure devices. If possible, only access online accounts from your personal computer, tablet, or smartphone while using a secured Internet connection. Try to limit accessing personal accounts from public computers that could be infected with spyware or malware, or may use an unsecured Internet connection. If you do use public computers, be sure to log out when you are finished. In general, it is more secure to use a smartphone’s cellular data network than a public or unsecured Internet connection.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Create strong passwords. To reduce the chances of your online accounts being hacked, change your passwords frequently. Strong passwords are at least 12 characters long, include numbers, letters, special characters (&,!,?, etc.), and are not too predictable. For example, don’t use your name or date of birth for your password or common words like “password.” If you have multiple online accounts, it is best to have a different password for each account. In the event that one of your accounts is hacked, having different passwords for your other accounts reduces the likelihood of those accounts being accessed too.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Use multifactor authentication on your accounts. Multifactor authentication works like this: When you enter your password for your email account, for example, you are directed to a page that asks for a four-digit code. Your email provider then sends a unique, temporary code in a text message or to another email account. You must enter the code, which expires after a short amount of time, to access your account. This means that hackers who obtained your password still can’t access your account unless they also have access to that verification code, adding another layer of protection. Many email providers, social media websites, and financial institutions now make it easy for users to set up multifactor authentication on their accounts.</label>
<br>
<label id="label">Be cautious with “Save my information for next time.” Many websites now store personal banking or credit card information to make it easier for you to buy a product or to pay a bill in the future. Although convenient, if your account is hacked, your payment information is more easily available to hackers. Ensure any website where you enter your financial information is secure (the website’s URL should start with “https://”—remember that the “s” is for “secure”), that your password is unique to that account, and that you log out once you are done.</label>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<label id="label">Sign up for account alerts. Many email providers and social media websites allow users to sign up for an email or text alert when your account is accessed from a new device or unusual location. These email or text alerts can quickly notify you when an unauthorized person accesses your account and can help minimize the amount of time an unauthorized user has access to your information. If you receive such an alert, login to your account immediately and change the password. Check these emails closely, however, since malicious “phishing” emails often mimic these kinds of alerts.</label>
